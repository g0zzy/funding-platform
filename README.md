## Overview [↑](#table-of-contents)

Funding Platform is a .NET Core MVC web application that displays fundings for a user to invest in. 

## Technologies Used [↑](#table-of-contents)
- .NET Core 3.1 
- Entity Framework Core 3.1 
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
- [Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL) - Provider for PostgreSQL database.
- [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) - Library for mapping one .NET object to another.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) - To run the database locally without installing Postgres and PgAdmin/Dbeaver.

## Solution Structure [↑](#table-of-contents)
- DigitalInvest.FundingPlatform- source code for the web app
  - DigitalInvest.FundingPlatform - main project
    - Configuration - settings classes to map from appSettings.json files 
    - Controllers - .NET Core MVC controllers 
    - DataAccess - data access layer with Entity Framework Core ORM
      - Entities - objects to be stored in database
    - Exceptions - custom exceptions created 
    - Extensions - extension classes to extend ability of certain classes for cleaner code 
    - Mappings - Automapper profiles that map from entities to view models and vice versa
    - Migrations - migrations to keep the database in sync with entities
    - Models - view models to be displayed in views 
    - Properties - includes launchSettings.json that has project specific settings associated with profile
    - Repository - layer abstracting the domain from data persistance 
    - Services - business logic injected to ASP.NET Core DI to be abstracted from presentation 
    - Views - handles the app's data presentation and user interaction using Razor markup
    - wwwroot - js scripts and css used in the presentation
  

## Local Machine Setup [↑](#table-of-contents)

1. Install VS2019, [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) along with [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/08_using_compose/).
2. Clone the repository. 
3. Go to DigitalInvest.FundingPlatform folder and open cmd/git bash to run the following command: 

`docker-compose up`

4. Open terminal or Package Manager Console in order to create the database. Run:
`dotnet ef database update` or `update-database` respectively.

5. If you want to connect to the database. Go to localhost:8978 to use CloudBeaver. Follow the instructions there.
db user and password are both `postgres`.

Go to `postgres` > `Schemas` > `public` > `Tables` > `Fundings` and you should see some data.

Good to go! 

Run your application on Visual Studio. 

## Requirements [↑](#table-of-contents)
•	User can see a list of fundings with investment required.

•	User click on a funding and submit an amount (between 100€ and 10.000€) for a funding.

•	Can only submit an amount once per funding.

## Solution [↑](#table-of-contents)

Current solution only considers one user. User can do all the things mentioned in requirements.
Ideally we would have several projects to divide the solution such as: Presentation (Views, Controllers etc), Data, Business, Repository, Tests. Business would be in the core and would not depend on any other projects. 
Due to time constraints, this architecture wasn't adopted.

## Improvements [↑](#table-of-contents)

Some of these could not be implemented, because of time constraints and some issues being faced. 

**Tests:** 
Unit tests should be implemented. 

**Authentication:**
Identity Server could be used to manage users easily. Jwt Token based authentication could be done - a custom authentication attribute could be implemented. 

**Many to many relationship:**
Many to many relationship between user and fundings because a funding can have many users and a user can invest in many fundings (in the future).

**Dockerize the app:**
Only the database part was dockerized for now. The application could also be brought up with the database services.

**Exception handling:** 
Global exception handling can be improved.

**Logging:** 
Logging was not implemented.

## Pain Points [↑](#table-of-contents)

MVC was adopted as I've worked with it a little previously, however this made things more complex and coupled. Some parts would have been implemented differently if API was implemented separately, eg. exception handling, API design (RESTful).
